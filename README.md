🐐 Goat Health Monitoring System (IoT + ML Dashboard)

A smart agricultural dashboard that predicts goat health conditions using IoT-driven vital parameters and machine learning logic.
This project demonstrates real-time monitoring, UI-based analytics, and intelligent health alerting for livestock management.

📌 Project Overview

Modern livestock farming lacks continuous automated health monitoring.
This project addresses that gap by:

✔ Collecting goat vitals
✔ Applying decision logic
✔ Providing health prediction
✔ Visualizing the results via dashboard

It serves as a functional prototype suitable for academic use, research presentation, and interview demonstration.

🚀 Features

✔ Modern interactive Streamlit dashboard
✔ Live health prediction logic
✔ Explanation of system architecture
✔ Results & insights summary
✔ Future enhancements roadmap

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit

Custom styled UI

🔍 How Prediction Works

User enters:

➡ Temperature
➡ Heart Rate
➡ Respiration Rate
➡ Estimated Weight

Decision logic evaluates the values and predicts whether the goat is:

🟢 Healthy
🔴 At risk / abnormal condition

📊 Architecture (Conceptual Flow)
IoT Necklace → Bluetooth Gateway → Cloud Processing → ML Model → Dashboard → Alerts


(Not fully implemented hardware side — this app focuses on UI + prediction logic.)

📈 Future Enhancements

🔹 Real ML model training & integration
🔹 Cloud database logging
🔹 Mobile app notifications
🔹 GPS herd tracking
🔹 Medicine scheduling assistant

🧪 How to Run Locally
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
